> anketeur, Haitian for 'someone asking questions.'

Anketeur is a small, flexible web app for conducting surveys.

## Status

Work In Progress -- Early stage.
A demo is accessible online at: http://anketeur.herokuapp.com/

## Goals

* The goal is to provide a simple yet flexible, self-contained web app for conducting surveys.
* Data should be in a readily accessible format, e.g. json, edn, csv

## Non-goals

* This app keeps user management minimal. Unless customized to integrate with authentication systems, pass-phrases can only be reset manually.

* This app does not send emails. It is up to the survey organizer to provide the link to the respondents.
